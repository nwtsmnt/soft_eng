Project Overview

Branch Structure

Our project follows a structured Git branching model:
master: Reserved for stable production-ready releases.
release: Used for preparing stable versions before deployment.
develop: Active development branch where all files and new features are currently being worked on.

Current Status

Since master and release branches are required to have a working version, but we do not have a stable release yet, all our files and active development take place in the develop branch.
